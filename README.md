# Webdavsync
This is a simple script for syncing a single file through Webdav.

Quality may be questional.

## Why did you make this?
I got an ARM laptop. The Synology Drive client which I usually use for syncing my password database does not support ARM. So I had to create this. Plus; it doesn't require an additional daemon.
